After untaring cprogramminglab-handout.tar, you follow the instructions in 
cprogramming.pdf to untar the folder. You can run "make" directly, but you
cannot run "make test", since "./driver.py" is used. 

- To run "make test":
1. Install python2 in your environment;
2. Change "./driver.py" in Makefile to "python2 ./driver.py";
3. Run "make test";

- To use "driver.py":
1. Install python2 in your environment;
2. Run "python2 driver.py".

The most tricky part in this lab is to pass trace case 11 and 12. You can try
commentting out the 2 lines in queue.c marked as "IMPORTANT", which would cause
memory leak. 
Lesson: when a function relies on the success of a series of memory allocation,
remember to free all previous allocated memory, in case any one of the memory
allocation step fails.
